# Progressive Web Apps 

## Chapter1

This repository contains the code for the book Progressive Web Apps for Chapter 1. The code files are in the _code_ subfolder.

## Getting started
The code examples themselves does not require any installation. 

For easy testing, I have included a basic webserver so that you can test the code without starting your own. Run `npm install` and then `npm start`. Open your webserver and go to `http://localhost:3000`.
